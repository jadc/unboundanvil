# Unbound Anvil
A Minecraft Fabric mod that reduces anvil restrictions.

**Unbound Anvil** reduces restrictions on anvil usage as minimally as possible, maintaining vanilla gameplay as much as possible.

This mod makes the following changes to the server side, and nothing more:
- Renaming an item always costs 1 level
- You can combine enchants (that have multiple levels) as much as you want
- You can combine any enchant, except Silk Touch with Fortune
- Removes the "Too Expensive" restriction when the price is above 40 levels
- Anvil XP cost increases like vanilla (x2 each time) until 35 levels; afterwards, it only increases by 1 level each time

Additionally, the mod removes the "Too Expensive" alert if (optionally) installed on the client.

This mod does *not* uncap max levels, so enchantment tables, villager trades, and loot tables are unaffected. Higher than normal enchantment levels are only obtainable by combining in an anvil.
